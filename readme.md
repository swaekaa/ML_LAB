# Student Lifestyle & Mental Health Analysis

This is a **minor lab project** focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a student lifestyle and mental health dataset.

The project explores how sleep habits, study hours, social media usage, and physical activity relate to **academic performance (CGPA)** and **mental health (stress & depression)**.

🚧 Updates and further improvements are in progress.
